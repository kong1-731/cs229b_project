Code associated with my CS229B project


Apparently the train_coeff files are too big to upload, so I have included the code necessary to generate these data files inside the training code. 

1. Download the 2019 Sepsis PhysioNet challenge winner (https://github.com/jambo6/sepsis_competition_physionet_2019) in order to use the dataloader functions inside the format.ipynb file and to download the data.

2. Unzip the train_val_test_sepsis_dataset folders and combine the contents into one train_val_test_sepsis_dataset folder

3. Use the format.ipynb code to generate the training, test, and validation data if necessary.

4. Use the training code to generate the hermite coefficient train data for use with Neural CDEs.

6. se the training code to train each type of model.
