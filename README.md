# cs229b_project
Code associated with my CS229B project


Apparently the files are too big to upload, so I have included the code necessary to generate the data files. 

1. Download the 2019 Sepsis PhysioNet challenge winner (https://github.com/jambo6/sepsis_competition_physionet_2019) in order to use the dataloader functions inside the format.ipynb file and to download the data.

2. Use the format.ipynb code to generate the training, test, and validation data.

3. Use the training code to train each type of model.
